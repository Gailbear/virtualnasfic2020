# Report Problems

## I am being mistreated by another participant.

If you are in any channel on [our Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/columbus2020nasfic) you can type @moderator into a message, and it will alert a moderator. You can also post in the #moderation-desk chat channel. Or find the current mod lead on duty in the pinned posts and private message them.

It is helpful to provide the username and/or Discord number of the person whose conduct you are reporting. You can see the number by clicking on their username in Discord.

## I have a problem attempting to use Discord chat, Vimeo Streams, or Twitch Streams to attend the convention.
