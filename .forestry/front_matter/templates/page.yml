  description: The order in which this page appears in the navigation menu. <strong>Every
    page must have a numeral here, or the whole site will stay the same and no longer
    take anyone's edits until this is fixed here.</strong> Don't spell it out like
    the word "two", don't make it a decimal, don't put quotes around it.
