# Online Dealers at NASFiC

Welcome to the NASFiC Virtual Dealer Room! Here you will find pictures and links to online purchasing our dealers have provided for your perusal. Every dealer listed is happy to accept orders remotely and is prepared to ship any new goodies you would like to acquire. We hope you enjoy your browsing!

We’re actually online, at the Con, in a virtual server, waiting to chat with you! Text and voice are available!

NASFiC 2020 is using Discord, and online virtual service, to let us talk to each other, just like we would if you were standing in my booth. If you’ve already got a Discord account, go here: [http://www.discord.gg/columbus2020nasfic](http://www.discord.gg/columbus2020nasfic "http://www.discord.gg/columbus2020nasfic")

If you don’t have a Discord account, it’s easy to set one up. (For a given value of easy.) Click the link above, and it will ask you to set up a Discord account. It requires an email, and a password, and a user name.

If you’re using an Android phone/tablet, you can download the Discord app from your favorite app store, like Google Play. The app is free. Do this first, then use the NASFiC Discord link to get your registration started.

If you’re on your home computer, you can download a computer app, or select open in browser. Open in browser is less fussy, so try that first. \[editor – using PC, Win 7, Chrome browser for my tests\]

The email and password you used to register are your login credentials. The user name is what people will see when you are online, and logged into Discord.

Discord will prompt you to create your own server. Do **Not** do this. Cancel, or X out of the popup box. You should now be at the Discord home screen. Look for a white button in a column to the left that shows the word Columbus. Click that, and you are at the Discord portion of NASFiC 2020.

Roughly in the center of your screen, you will see categories, like Info. Those are the categories where there are channels, which are like chat rooms. Look for the Category Dealers’Room. (It will be below Program Rooms. Keep scrolling.)

Right under Dealers, you’ll see #dealers-room, and then a scroll down roll of dealer shop names, all starting with #. This is where we are! Click on dealers and say hello, or go to our channel directly and say hello! \[#vendors-channel-here\]

Welcome In!
