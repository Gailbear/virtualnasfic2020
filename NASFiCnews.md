# NASFiC News

## Issue 1: Friday

Welcome to the 2020 NASFiC! And to the first issue of the newsletter! If you'd like to submit something for a future newsletter, please enter it in the #newsletter-submissions channel on Discord!

### Warm Body Count

As of 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Friday, 245 people have registered on Discord! _(ed: Haven't joined Discord yet? Do it so you can be counted!)_

### Discord Tips

There's a lot more to the convention than just the website! Be sure to [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/columbus2020nasfic) and check out the virtual bar, fan tables, info desk and so much more! Here are some tips to make your Discord experience smoother.

1. Can't get past registration? Be sure to click the SMALL thumbs up icon at the bottom of the page - it's the one with a number next to it, and that number will go up when you click it. That unlocks the rest of the server!
2. Change your nickname so it's easier for friends to find you and for people to tell who you are! You can have a unique nickname for each server that you're on. Just click on the down arrow next to NASFiC Columbus on the upper left and choose "change nickname."
3. Discord can get overwhelming when there are a lot of channels! Not interested in gaming? Right click on the "gaming category" and select "mute"- then you won't get any notices about unread messages in gaming channels. You can mute individual channels or entire categories.
4. Tired of the beeping? You can turn off notification sounds and adjust many other aspects of your Discord experience by clicking on the settings icon next to your name in the lower left. To turn off noises, click on settings icon, then notifications, and scroll down to select which sounds you'd like to hear (or never hear again). You can also adjust notification settings on a channel or category basis just like muting (above).
5. Having trouble seeing the scroll bars? Try going to user settings, then appearance, and changing your theme from dark to light, see if you like that better!
6. Be careful in voice channels! Voice channels are marked in Discord with a speaker icon. Unlike text channels, leaving a voice channel does NOT remove you from the channel. And depending on your microphone setting that means you may be unknowingly broadcasting to that voice channel as you go about your day. Always make sure to click the disconnect button.

### Fan GoH Chris Garcia News

Please share your positive thoughts, hopes, prayers - as appropriate - and spare a moment of contemplation for Christopher J. Garcia (GOH), his wonderful family Vanessa, John Paul and Ben, as they await news of their home, and neighbourhood, evacuated as they are from Boulder Creek in the Santa Cruz County CZU August Lightning Complex Fire. Certainly, we all wish them well. _(submitted by James Bacon)_

### Fan Fund Auction needs you!

Fan Funds like GUFF, DUFF and LAFF enable fans to travel to other countries and continents to attend their major conventions and meet the local fans. They are funded through donations and fan fund auctions. The [NASFiC fan fund auction](https://www.facebook.com/events/s/nasfic-fan-fund-auction/322469925862126/ ) is being organized on Facebook. Visit the page to donate an item (any time) or bid on an item (after 4 pm Friday).

Current items include Tuckerizations from Gillian Pollack, a knitted lace shawl from Esther MacCallum-Stewart, a private mixology less from Tammy Coxen (_ed: #shamelessselfpromotion_) and more! Including this fabulous Skele-Posse plush Sabbath from Emily the Strange, donated by Geri Sullivan.

### What is this whole NASFiC thing about anyway?

Where and why was the first NASFiC held? Which NASFiC misspelled its own name? Which NASFiC included an excursion on a riverboat? Or had a wet dog party? Find out the [fascinating history](https://columbus2020nasfic.org/nasfic-history.html) of the **N**orth **A**merican **S**cience **Fi**ction **C**onvention.

### Gaming Goes Digital!

Check out the Digital Gaming category in Discord if you'd like to get your game on! There are several options (which you opt into by clicking a particular reaction). Want to go on a spacefaring adventure? Gaming is running Artemis Starship Bridge Simulator 2.4.0 and Horizons Starship Bridge Simulator. For Horizons, you'll just need a broswer window open for game. For Artemis you will need to have the game installed on your device. Windows and Mac users can download the app from the pinned post in #artemis-sbs (the convention has 5 bridge licenses which cover using the app with our servers). On Android or iOS you will have to purchase the app. 

Looking for something closer to earth? A variety of party games will be offered through Jackbox (you'll just need a browser window to play those) and there's a channel for organizing your own pickup games too, using your online gaming venue of choice.
