# HOW TO ATTEND?

Attending the North American Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention will now be easy as everything will be online! Please be patient with us while we update our website and get ready for this event.

It will be free, but we will still accept donations. Any memberships purchased below will be considered donations from this point forward. That said we are working on a new way to access our content that will be on this page in the near future.

If you would like to help us make this event a success, please contact nasfictransition@gmail.com or fill out our [volunteer survey](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fform.jotform.com%2F201906040573044%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1Ew0C2VAPu0xPjZwV0glAhTAgcvtZMHHm5130KPjXpjHSzGN0JdPxo5eg&h=AT0Aw75Egyr5JvyQhzvzmdk6wogK8OhHVNYER10DP0Drm3CmF6Uz5PHNEY1lmw_rUzqIpqkqsCKuOq8ajK2fpoRO92xxNgInX75lPlYVE0gH6ePntua8v8ZZgYxFwl5-4rQ).
