# HOW TO ATTEND?

Attending the North American Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention will now be easy as everything will be online!

On the day the convention begins, the page you are viewing now will provide you with a virtual "log book". When you have signed it, this website will provide you access to several more pages, with embedded chat channels and streaming video.

It will be free, but we will still accept donations. 

If you would like to help us make this event a success, please contact nasfictransition@gmail.com or fill out our [volunteer survey](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fform.jotform.com%2F201906040573044%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1Ew0C2VAPu0xPjZwV0glAhTAgcvtZMHHm5130KPjXpjHSzGN0JdPxo5eg&h=AT0Aw75Egyr5JvyQhzvzmdk6wogK8OhHVNYER10DP0Drm3CmF6Uz5PHNEY1lmw_rUzqIpqkqsCKuOq8ajK2fpoRO92xxNgInX75lPlYVE0gH6ePntua8v8ZZgYxFwl5-4rQ). In particular, we need volunteers to moderate the chat channels for presentations, and convey the questions to the streaming presenters.
