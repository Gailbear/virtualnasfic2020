## New "Virtual" Dates: Friday, August 21 - Sunday, August 23

We've been exploring the possibility of providing an Online event for all of you. We are happy to announce that this is now a reality. We have a small team working hard to put together the best online event we can for you to enjoy at the end of August. Due to our transition we've revised our dates to reflect the limit of our planning capabilities at this point; they are now Friday, August 21st-Sunday, August 23rd.

## What exactly is Worldcon or NASFiC? How are they related?

The World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) is an annual convention held since 1939 (skipping 1942-1945), which gathers fans (and pros) from around the world. Worldcon is also where members vote for the Hugo awards.

Whenever Worldcon is held off of North America, a North American Science Fiction Convention (NASFiC), is optionally held as well. The NASFiC is an alternative for fans who can't make it to Worldcon overseas. The location of the NASFiC is determined by members of a Worldcon (or NASFiC) through a voting process.

Worldcon 78 (2020) will be held in Wellington, New Zealand. Visit [https://conzealand.nz](https://conzealand.nz "https://conzealand.nz") for details. The NASFiC for 2020 was to be in Columbus, OH. Both became virtual conventions held online.
