### What exactly is Worldcon or NASFiC? How are they related?

The World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) is an annual convention held since 1939 (skipping 1942-1945), which gathers fans (and pros) from around the world. Worldcon is also where members vote for the Hugo awards.

Whenever Worldcon is held off of North America, a North American Science Fiction Convention (NASFiC), is optionally held as well. The NASFiC is an alternative for fans who can't make it to Worldcon overseas. The location of the NASFiC is determined by members of a Worldcon (or NASFiC) through a voting process.

Worldcon 78 (2020) will be held in Wellington, New Zealand. Visit [https://conzealand.nz](https://conzealand.nz "https://conzealand.nz") for details. The NASFiC for 2020 was to be in Columbus, OH. Both became virtual conventions held online.
