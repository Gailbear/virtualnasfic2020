# virtualnasfic2020

Matt Arnold, matt.mattarn+nasfic@gmail.com

If you're seeing this, you are staff of Columbus NASFiC 2020. I added you as an editor of our Virtual NASFiC Access Portal. Forestry.io will serve as a content editing tool for the site. This cannot edit things like colors, layout, fonts, spacing, or other presentational design decisions. Just bold, italic, headlines, links, and lists. **That is intentional.** This is intended to create, update, and delete only content-- bare words and images. The layout and styling is handled by the site itself. If you would like any styling changes, please describe it to me (Matt Arnold matt.mattarn+nasfic@gmail.com), and I will quickly implement it for you.

Your work here will be reflected on the site, typically with a delay of a minute or two. The site temporarily is at this domain:

https://mattarnold.github.io/virtualnasfic2020/

Please do not be shy at all about playing around with Forestry. You can't break anything that I cannot quickly roll back. You can add more pages to the site if you wish.

This is the Sidebar. In "Schedule Entries" and "Dealer Entries", you can create or edit individual scheduled events or dealers. Think of these as rows in a table. If you want to add a table with a new kind of data to the site, I can add it for you here.

In "Pages", you can pick out which Page you wish to edit or create.

"Posts" would be for making blog posts, but we are not running a blog at the moment. Feel free to request that I set up this feature.

"Media" lets you upload images or other media assets to the site, so that you can use them when editing a page.

When you're creating or editing a Page, **be sure to read and follow** the explanatory instruction labels that I wrote on all these fields. For example, in "Category", you have to type the word "pages".

</div>

You can just type into this whole area, and select part or all of what you've typed. It's a typical text editor. The large font line at the top is part of the editor too. It's set to be a headline paragraph.

A quick way to create a bulleted list is to start a line with a dash, then a space.

This toolbar will make your text selection in the editor into bold, italic, a hyperlink, or a list.

You can click the { } button to see some snippets I set up for you. Snippets are basically macros with some parts where you need to type in the specifics. Let me know if there are any repetitive bits of text that you would like me to set up as a snippet.

Click the image button to add an image. Remember that you need to go to the sidebar and click "Media" to upload your image.

If we published a page, and you turn "Draft" to "ON", the page no longer appears on the site.

If you do some work on a published page, but you don't want the work to appear on the site yet, don't turn on "Draft", or the page would be invisible on the site. Instead, just leave this editor without clicking the "Save" button. Never fear-- Forestry saved your work for you automatically. The next time you come back to the editor for this page, Forestry will ask you if you wish to restore your work here,or discard it.

"Preview" is currently broken. I'm working with Forestry support to find out why.

Do you know Markdown? It's what you use when writing a Reddit comment, to add bold and italic and whatnot. This entire system is secretly converting your work to Markdown for you. If you prefer to type Markdown directly, click the three-dot symbol in the upper right, and from the menu, choose "Raw Editor".
