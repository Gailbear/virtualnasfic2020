# NASFIC VIRTUAL ART SHOW

## **Art Show Information and Guidelines**

All artwork must somehow relate to science fiction, fantasy, or actual science. (Fortunately, this leaves lots of room to work in.) While we encourage a wide and varied assortment of styles and subject matter of art in the art show, we reserve the right to reject any art which violates local laws.

Please read this FAQ before you [fill out the application](https://forms.gle/DhjDUFbhoLWL3NpC9), if you are interested in being an artist at NASFiC 2020. You will be expected to abide by the information and rules presented here if you apply and are accepted into the Art Show

## **What’s going on? What IS this?**

NASFiC 2020 has cancelled our physical convention due to pandemic safety concerns. We are instead presenting a virtual convention event over the same weekend, August 20-23, 2020. This event will be online primarily through use of a Discord Server, the Columbus 2020 NASFiC website, and may also have a presence on Twitch, Zoom and YouTube. Please check the NASFiC website for further information. As this is new territory for all concerned we don’t know what it will end up being but we won’t find out unless we start doing!

We are planning our virtual Art Show experience to be 2 parts; a website gallery and collection of links and a dedicated Discord channel for the convention weekend. The first will allow attendees to see a curated list of Artists with links to their websites and shops; the second will allow Artist a chance to chat online via text, audio, or webcam with attendees during the convention.

## **Who’s going to be there?**

We hope to welcome virtual attendees that were originally planning to come to NASFiC as well as any other interested people. This event is free to the public.

We hope YOU are too! While we can’t offer you the experience we were originally planning we would like to adhere to the spirit of what was originally planned so any dealer that was accepted into NASFiC 2020 before cancellation is automatically welcome to participate.

## **I’m not a previously accepted NASFiC artist. Is this only for them?**

As this is a virtual experience we are no longer limited to physical location and we are happy to entertain new applications from artists from anywhere! That said, we still plan to curate this room for content and balance.. We are a family-oriented event with a focus on science fiction and fantasy.
