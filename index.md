Dear Members,

We have put a great team together to make this NASFiC totally VIRTUAL! In the next two weeks we will be solidifying those who are participating in the program, the Art Show, the Masquerade, the Dealer's Room, and the writer's Workshop, as well as who will be hosting club tables and parties. If you want to do any of those things, please contact us ASAP.  None of this works without volunteers, just like in the real world, so please, [volunteer](https://form.jotform.com/201906040573044?fbclid=IwAR1I79sPqqTA08fb3Ue4yMIkZR_913tq87qv5dnlg6pHrw0mTCUDrk8mKPQ) early and often. 

And of course we still have our wonderful Guests of Honor:

#### Toastmaster and Filker Tom Smith

#### Editor  Chris Garcia

#### Artist  Stephanie Law

#### Authors  Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson

#### Scientist  Marc Millis

#### Fans  Steve and Sue Francis

#### Ring of Fire Guest  Eric Flint

Opening Ceremonies is at 3 pm on Friday, August 21st. That evening will also include a memorial to the great author, editor and mentor Mike Resnick, who unfortunately died in the past year.  Mike was a regular at Ohio cons and we are honored that his wife Carol and daughter Laura are giving us the honor of trusting us with this event.

Other highlights for the weekend will include the Chesley Awards and the Prometheus Awards.  Please give yourself a break from the mundane world and join us, for the 2020 North American Science Fiction Convention!

Dear Members,

Along with ongoing negotiations with our Hotel, we've been exploring the possibility of providing an Online event for all of you. We are happy to announce that this is now a reality. We have a small team working hard to put together the best online event we can for you to enjoy at the end of August. Due to our transition we've revised our dates to reflect the limit of our planning capabilities at this point; they are now Friday, August 21st-Sunday, August 23rd.

As you may know, the skills required to run a virtual event are different from those required to run an in person event. We held off on announcing this digital transformation until we were able to confirm with enough of our staff and guests that they were able and willing to help with a virtual convention that we knew that we'd actually be able to provide you with content.

In recognition of the difficulty of these times we are offering this event for Free with optional donation. We will be reaching out to all our paid members to make sure they have the opportunity to enjoy the content we're putting together, and are also going to be opening it up to other's who would like to join.

If you would like to volunteer with us in this challenging transition please fill out [our volunteer survey](https://form.jotform.com/201906040573044?fbclid=IwAR1I79sPqqTA08fb3Ue4yMIkZR_913tq87qv5dnlg6pHrw0mTCUDrk8mKPQ). If you would like to join us as a program participant please email program@columbus2020nasfic.org .
