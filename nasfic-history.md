The 1970 Worldcon was held in Heidelberg, West Germany. According to Ben Yalow, “An unofficial alternative convention was held in Toronto for those who couldn't attend Heicon. As a result of the good feelings coming from this, at Noreascon (1971) the next year an amendment was made to the WSFS bylaws which stated that whenever a non-North American Worldcon was held, an interim Continental Convention would be held in the North American zone that would have been eligible to hold the Worldcon.”

The view of Toronto’s alternative convention as a successful, unofficial tryout of the NASFiC was not shared by some of that city’s leading fans. This mattered because the 1973 Worldcon was going to be held in Toronto, and the 1973 Worldcon would vote on Australia’s bid for 1975 Worldcon.

An Aussie victory would open the way for selection of the first NASFiC, which was sought by two bidders, both from Los Angeles. Or make that – sought by two gluttons for punishment. Each bid was led by a co-chair of L.A.Con I, the just-completed Worldcon, Charles Crayne or Bruce Pelz. But Toronto’s chairman, John Millard, advised by fan attorney Kenneth Smookler, took the position that the NASFiC rules were _ultra vires_, that is, outside the Worldcon-running purpose of WSFS. They would not administer the NASFiC site selection.

Crayne and Pelz reacted to TorCon 2’s simply by running their own site selection process at the con. I got my first bidding experience while helping Bruce Pelz and Milt Stevens haul cases of beer from a package store to their bid party in Toronto’s Royal York Hotel. “Strong backs, weak minds,” I think Bruce said. When the ballots were counted, we (Bruce and Milt may be thinking, “What do you mean, _we_?”) lost to Chuck Crayne’s bid. _\~Mike Glyer_

NorthAmericon’s highlight was a riverboat ride on the Belle of Louisville. It being a NASFiC, there was a little carping by a fan who commented that only 500 fans went on the cruise, including the entire committee, but nothing was planned for the other two-thirds of the members left on shore. Hm, makes me think of another cruise where people complained there weren’t enough lifeboats. _\~ Mike Glyer_

NorthAmeriCon '79 was the second NASFiC to be held when the Worldcon was held out of North America. The convention was held over the Labor Day weekend in 1979 in Louisville, KY. It started as a "Nashville is Neat in 100 Degree Heat" ad in a 1975 MidAmeriCon progress report. This ad was a big joke pulled on Khen Moore by Ken Keller, who was MidAmeriCon's chairman. It started to take off as a Worldcon bid for Nashville when Khen got a bad case of Worldcon fever. As it became more and more obvious that Nashville did not have the needed hotel space (this was before the Opryland Hotel was a factor) the bid somehow migrated north to Louisville as a NASFiC bid. _\~ Steve & Sue Francis_

A Southern fandom con tradition in the 70s was to go skinnydipping at midnight, and this tradition was followed at NorthAmericon. Unbeknownst to the swimmers, however, one wall of the pool featured portholes to the hotel bar. Drinkers probably were shocked sober by the sight of some of the fans swimming by. _\~ Fancyclopedia_
