The 1970 Worldcon was held in Heidelberg, West Germany. According to Ben Yalow, “An unofficial alternative convention was held in Toronto for those who couldn't attend Heicon. As a result of the good feelings coming from this, at Noreascon (1971) the next year an amendment was made to the WSFS bylaws which stated that whenever a non-North American Worldcon was held, an interim Continental Convention would be held in the North American zone that would have been eligible to hold the Worldcon.”

The view of Toronto’s alternative convention as a successful, unofficial tryout of the NASFiC was not shared by some of that city’s leading fans. This mattered because the 1973 Worldcon was going to be held in Toronto, and the 1973 Worldcon would vote on Australia’s bid for 1975 Worldcon.

An Aussie victory would open the way for selection of the first NASFiC, which was sought by two bidders, both from Los Angeles. Or make that – sought by two gluttons for punishment. Each bid was led by a co-chair of L.A.Con I, the just-completed Worldcon, Charles Crayne or Bruce Pelz. But Toronto’s chairman, John Millard, advised by fan attorney Kenneth Smookler, took the position that the NASFiC rules were _ultra vires_, that is, outside the Worldcon-running purpose of WSFS. They would not administer the NASFiC site selection.

Crayne and Pelz reacted to TorCon 2’s simply by running their own site selection process at the con. I got my first bidding experience while helping Bruce Pelz and Milt Stevens haul cases of beer from a package store to their bid party in Toronto’s Royal York Hotel. “Strong backs, weak minds,” I think Bruce said. When the ballots were counted, we (Bruce and Milt may be thinking, “What do you mean, _we_?”) lost to Chuck Crayne’s bid. _\~Mike Glyer_

NorthAmericon’s highlight was a riverboat ride on the Belle of Louisville. It being a NASFiC, there was a little carping by a fan who commented that only 500 fans went on the cruise, including the entire committee, but nothing was planned for the other two-thirds of the members left on shore. Hm, makes me think of another cruise where people complained there weren’t enough lifeboats. NorthAmericon’s highlight was a riverboat ride on the Belle of Louisville.

NorthAmeriCon '79 was the second NASFiC to be held when the Worldcon was held out of North America. The convention was held over the Labor Day weekend in 1979 in Louisville, KY. It started as a "Nashville is Neat in 100 Degree Heat" ad in a 1975 MidAmeriCon progress report. This ad was a big joke pulled on Khen Moore by Ken Keller, who was MidAmeriCon's chairman. It started to take off as a Worldcon bid for Nashville when Khen got a bad case of Worldcon fever. As it became more and more obvious that Nashville did not have the needed hotel space (this was before the Opryland Hotel was a factor) the bid somehow migrated north to Louisville as a NASFiC bid. _\~ Steve & Sue Francis_

A Southern fandom con tradition in the 70s was to go skinnydipping at midnight, and this tradition was followed at NorthAmericon. Unbeknownst to the swimmers, however, one wall of the pool featured portholes to the hotel bar. Drinkers probably were shocked sober by the sight of some of the fans swimming by. _\~ Fancyclopedia_

The First Occasional Lone Star Science Fiction Convention and Chili Cook-Off was the most popular NASFiC ever. The bidding committee was as big, dynamic and creative as the state of Texas. They had the best bid party at the 1983 Worldcon in Baltimore, and Site Selection voters who picked Australia to host the 1985 Worldcon rewarded the LoneStarCon committee by approving Austin, Texas to host the 1985 NASFiC. LoneStarCon’s guests of honor included Jack Vance, a reclusive author attending his first large American con, artist Richard Powers, and fan Joanne Burger, co-founder of the Houston SF Society.

LoneStarCon had an exceptionally large and diverse program. Its most popular item was the Secular Humanist Revival, a satirical event led by Orson Scott Card and John M. Ford. Jane Jewell wrote in Locus: “Card called on the congregation to confess their beliefs in logic, reason and the scientific method…. Rev. Card invited members of the audience to testify for their favorite scientific theory by boldly writing it on a sheet of paper, signing their name, and passing it to the front. The Reverend then respectfully intoned the names of these theories, most of which were met with enthusiastic applause…. Gravity received a particularly thunderous ovation.

One of the more crowded parties was the Aussiecon II reunion, involving around 150 members of NASFiC who came there straight from the Australian Worldcon.  _\~ Mike Glyer_

# 1987 - CactusCon

September 3 to 7, 1987  
Phoenix Hyatt Regency Adams Hilton, Phoenix  
Convention Center  
Phoenix, Arizona

**_Chair:_** Bruce Farr

**_Attendance:_** 2,800

Phoenix held back nothing as it prepared for an honored guest. However, that turned out to be the Pope, who was in town at about the same time.

Marjii Ellers, fan GoH, embodied fannish high spirits, wearing antenna to panels and working indefatigably on the costume programming. CactusCon was a magnet for costumers. Locus said such a large Masquerade was expected that the committee divided it into Friday and Saturday night sessions, possibly in reaction to the ’84 Worldcon’s marathon costume event. (However, Janice Gelb reported one of CactusCon’s sessions involved only 20 costumes.)

By 1987, dances were becoming major evening fare at American conventions. CactusCon ran a 50’s dance one night and a 70’s rock and roll party the next night. Another sign of the times was the presence of a CompuServe SF Forum party.

The pseudo-highlight of CactusCon was the lead story of the hoax daily newzine, reporting: “Calamity on the Hyatt’s fourth floor last night, as drunken revelers at the Alcor Life Extension party took their cryonics equipment and invaded the ‘Hell in ‘91’ hoax bid party. Hell froze over, and as a result Harper & Row has announced The Last Dangerous Visions for publication this spring.”

However, it’s hard to top the con’s most unusual program item. Mary Mason led a dozen participants armed with scalpels in a study of the anatomy and function of pig brains. Jane Jewell wrote, “I arrived near the end of the hour to find an enthusiastic group slicing away at the pig’s brains provided by the committee.” \~ Mike Glyer

# 1990 - ConDiego

August 30 to September 3, 1990  
Omni Hotel, San Diego Convention & Performing Arts Center  
San Diego, California

\**_Guests of Honor:  
_**Samuel R. Delany (pro)  
Ben Yalow (fan)

**_Chair:_** Albert Lafreniere II

**_Attendance:_** 3,000

Neither a fine speech by pro GoH Samuel Delany, an excellent Masquerade, a well-stocked Dealer’s Room, a top-quality Press Relations department, nor a successful Regency Dance, could divert the avalanche of sentiment which quickly made ConDiego a byword for haphazard convention-running. Not after fans were handed a typo-riddled Program Book which misspelled the hotel’s name, the guests of honors’ names and even the con’s own name – that in headline type: ConDigeo. And not after fans started seeing other problems and glitches. Not even herculean efforts behind the scenes by the other GoH, conrunning guru Ben Yalow, could bind up so many loose ends.

Most fans responded with a crotchety sense of humor. Someone coined an immortal wordplay referencing The Princess Bride: “My name is ConDigeo Montoya. You killed my weekend. Prepare to die!”

Even so, there were still many events of interest. Taras Wolansky’s con report is full of program highlights. He encountered one of sf’s most colorful real-life characters, Thorarin Gunnarson, writer, Danish television personality and Icelandic opera singer. Wolansky snorted at Julian May’s attitude about psychics who are revealed to be frauds: It’s tragic, she said, when people with real psychic powers are forced by circumstances to become charlatans! And he enjoyed hearing Sheila Finch talk about her story in the Benford anthology Hitler Victorious, on the leading wave of today’s thriving alternate history sub-genre. _\~Mike Glyer_

# 1995 - Dragon*Con 1995

July 13 to 16, 1995  
Atlanta Hilton & Towers, Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, Atlanta Civic Center  
Atlanta, Georgia

**_Guests of Honor:_**  
George Alec Effinger (writer)  
Harlan Ellison (writer)  
Timothy Zahn (writer)  
Michael Whelan (artist)  
Bjo Trimble (fan)

**_Chair:_** Ed Kramer

**Attendance**_:_ 14,312*

_* Despite Dragon*Con’s overall attendance of 14,000, Locus estimates only about 1,000 came just for the NASFiC. This may not have offset the cost of special things done to enhance the NASFiC side of the con._

When the Atlanta bid for the 1995 Worldcon was defeated by the Glasgow bid, an unrelated group of fans connected with Atlanta’s huge annual popular culture convention, Dragon-Con, successfully bid to hold NASFiC in conjunction with their event in July 1995. Reports suggest that the Dragon-Con committee and Worldcon regulars who went looking for the NASFiC’s promise of “Worldcon-style convention” both came away feeling they’d gotten less in return than the experience cost them.

The committee did a number of things designed to appeal to fans looking for a focus on printed sf. In addition to its own slate of GoHs, Dragon*Con named as “NASFiC Honored Guests” George Alec Effinger, Harlan Ellison, Bjo Trimble, Michael Whelan, Timothy Zahn. They also hosted several major awards ceremonies. Charles N. Brown agreed to have the Locus Awards presented there, with Joe Haldeman as MC. The Chesley and Prometheus Awards were also given at the con.

Of more lasting notoriety, many who came for NASFiC reacted critically to the rest of Dragon-Con. Charles N. Brown wrote in Locus, “On the whole, the super-combined convention did not work well. The program, all 18 tracks of it, was out-of-hand and badly organized.” Having gone to the trouble of importing non-media guests, Dragon-Con/NASFiC seemed to have little idea what to do with them. George Alec Effinger was assigned to one reading, one autograph session, and no panels, and finished his assigned duties on the second day of the con. The reading was scheduled opposite Harlan Ellison's talk!

Fans could not believe that the art show was crowded into a tiny space with aisles only 30" wide (not as wide as some fans….) Some were astonished by the huge amount of pornography and bondage equipment for sale. Overall, the experience showed it was not really possible to graft a Worldcon-style NASFiC onto a huge popular culture convention and satisfy the fans of either. _\~Mike Glyer_
