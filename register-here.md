# HOW TO ATTEND?

#### Attending the North American Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention will now be easy as everything will be online!

#### On the day the convention begins, the page you are viewing now will provide you with a virtual "log book". When you have signed it, this website will provide you access to several more pages, with embedded chat channels and streaming video.

#### It will be free, but we will still accept donations.
