# SOLAE's Code of Conduct Anti-Harassment Policy:

We do not tolerate harassment of the people at our conventions in any form.

In order to take action, the convention needs to know about any incident during that convention.

Everyone is entitled to a harassment-free convention experience, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, or physical appearance.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking or following someone, making harassing photography or recordings, and disrupting talks or other events. Anyone asked to stop any unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

A request to “stop” or “go away” means exactly that. If anyone engages in harassing behavior, the convention committee may warn the offender, remove the offender from the room, or expel the offender from the convention with no refund at that convention Chairs’ discretion.

If you feel that you are being harassed, or if you notice someone violating hotel or convention policies, we respectfully suggest the following:

If you feel comfortable doing so, point out the inappropriate behavior to the persons involved. Often this will solve the problem immediately.

If you do not feel comfortable talking with the persons involved or if talking to them does not resolve the issue, please report the situation, in person, immediately to the Operations Staff, or a Convention Committee member. Try to provide a name (found on all badges) and/or a physical description of the person or persons involved.

In order to take action, we need to know about any incident during that convention.

## Due to the digital nature of our event we are interpreting that as follows:

Everyone is entitled to a safe, harassment-free convention experience, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion or physical appearance (this list is not exclusive of other marginalized classes).

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual attention, offensive comments, intimidation,  unauthorized photography or recordings, and disrupting talks or other events.  Anyone asked to stop is expected to comply immediately.

A request to “stop” or “go away” means exactly that.  If anyone engages in harassing or unsafe behavior, the convention committee may warn the offender, temporarily remove or mute the offender, or permanently ban the offender from the convention.

Additionally, all spaces are expected to be family-friendly outside of the virtual-bar.  If your conversation is moving out of acceptable PG-13 range and you are asked to take it to the bar please do so.

If you feel that you are being harassed, or if you notice someone engaging in concerning behavior, we respectfully suggest the following:

If you feel comfortable doing so, point out the inappropriate behavior to the persons involved.  Often this will solve the problem immediately.

If you do not feel comfortable talking with the persons involved or if talking to them does not resolve the issue, please report the situation to the @Moderator team if in Discord, or the Zoom Host if in Zoom meeting rooms.  Try to provide a name or, ideally, full discord handle(s) of the person or persons involved and/or screenshots of the problematic behavior.

You can also email this information to operations@columbus2020nasfic.org but tagging or messaging the @Moderator team is the fastest and best way to report something on discord.
