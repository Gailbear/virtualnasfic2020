  description: How have our visions of a free, dynamic and better future, with universal
    respect for each other’s rights, evolved and changed in science fiction/fantasy?
    What about cautionary dystopian visions, from Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm to
    Doctorow’s Little Brother? Prometheus-winning authors Sarah Hoyt (Darkship Thieves)
    and F. Paul Wilson (An Enemy of the State, Repairman Jack series) will join journalists
    Michael Grossberg (LFS co-founder) and Tom Jackson in examining the perennial
    tensions between Liberty and Power and cooperation versus coercion, as reflected
    in these and other authors’ diverse Prometheus Award winners over the past 40
