    uncovered the rules of rhetoric and syntax underlying the titles developers give
    their games. By following these rules, he was able to create dozens of realistic-sounding
    fictional games from distinct alien cultures. Over the past ten years, video game
    developers in the real world have subverted and played with these rules, expanding
    what a game's title can say about the experience of play. In this presentation,
    Leonard goes over the rules and talks about how they've changed over time.
