  description: In 2009, while writing a novel about alien video games, Leonard Richardson
    uncovered the rules of rhetoric and syntax underlying the titles developers give
    their games. By following these rules, he was able to create dozens of realistic-sounding
    fictional games from distinct alien cultures. Over the past ten years, video game
    developers in the real world have subverted and played with these rules, expanding
    what a game's title can say about the experience of play. In this presentation,
    Leonard goes over the rules and talks about how they've changed over time.

    us a view into who we are today and who we may become tomorrow, Today, policing
    is creating history in unprecedented ways from the tragic murder of George Floyd
    in Minneapolis to elected parliamentarians being stopped in London because they
    are Black, the brutal suppression of hope and democracy in Hong Kong.  How is
    the trope of police and/or law enforcement depicted in science fiction? Is there
    potential for exploring new law enforcement options?  Is there a solution in SF
    that can help to deconstruct, redesign, and rebuild a police force that truly
    reflects a better future? What questions do you want to ask and answer?
