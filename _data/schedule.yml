  description: 'The Legal Implications of Monster Hunting: Discussing and analyzing
    the implications of hunting vampires, demons, and other monsters in shows like
    Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, and Wynonna Earp. Should vampires have
    due process? Can a monster hunter be liable if a demon''s host dies during an
    exorcism? If it is murder to kill a monster, is being chosen or cursed to do so
    a plausible defense? Could ghosts have property rights to the houses they haunt
    if they lived there first? If they do, is expelling them an unlawful eviction?'

  description: How have our visions of a free, dynamic and better future, with universal
    respect for each other’s rights, evolved and changed in science fiction/fantasy?
    What about cautionary dystopian visions, from Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm to
    Doctorow’s Little Brother? Prometheus-winning authors Sarah Hoyt (Darkship Thieves)
    and F. Paul Wilson (An Enemy of the State, Repairman Jack series) will join journalists
    Michael Grossberg (LFS co-founder) and Tom Jackson in examining the perennial
    tensions between Liberty and Power and cooperation versus coercion, as reflected
