  description: 'See how to convert inspirational science fiction into science and
    engineering, by transforming the fiction into the first step of the scientific
    method: ''Defining the Problem.'' The case study uses the fiction of non-rocket
    space drives, which can levitate above the ground and then ascend effortlessly
    into space. Multiple fictional images are examined, toyed with, distilled with
    analogies, and finally set in the context of a problem definition to guide credible
    inquires.'

  description: In 2009, while writing a novel about alien video games, Leonard Richardson
    uncovered the rules of rhetoric and syntax underlying the titles developers give
    their games. By following these rules, he was able to create dozens of realistic-sounding
    fictional games from distinct alien cultures. Over the past ten years, video game
    developers in the real world have subverted and played with these rules, expanding
    what a game's title can say about the experience of play. In this presentation,
    Leonard goes over the rules and talks about how they've changed over time.

    this issue. SF often uses police to examine the gray areas of good vs bad as well
    as to question authority and explore the evolution of our humanity, it also gives
    us a view into who we are today and who we may become tomorrow, Today, policing
    is creating history in unprecedented ways from the tragic murder of George Floyd
    in Minneapolis to elected parliamentarians being stopped in London because they
    are Black, the brutal suppression of hope and democracy in Hong Kong.  How is
    the trope of police and/or law enforcement depicted in science fiction? Is there
    potential for exploring new law enforcement options?  Is there a solution in SF
    that can help to deconstruct, redesign, and rebuild a police force that truly
    reflects a better future? What questions do you want to ask and answer?
