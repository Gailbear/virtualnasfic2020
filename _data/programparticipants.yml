    However, he does have two dozen albums, fourteen Pegasus Awards for excellence
    in filk, a spot in the Filk Hall of Fame, and a decent collection of movies, games,
    comics, and Lego, so we took pity and let him in. He'll have at least two concerts
    this weekend, filled with ludicrous whimsy, dark romance, and multilingual puns.
    You have been warned.
