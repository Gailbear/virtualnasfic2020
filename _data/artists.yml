    at my first convention, Inconjunction in 1983. The next year I began selling my
    art on t-shirts, Marcon in Columbus was the first convention that I was selling
    my art on t-shirts. Many people knew me as “that guy who airbrushes t-shirts”
    in the dealers room. I continue to produce art for t-shirts at my company OffWorld
