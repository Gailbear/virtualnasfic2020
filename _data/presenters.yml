  description: 'Stephanie Law is a multi-media artist and illustrator from California.
    Primarily working in watercolor, gold and silver leaf, and ink, she adds texture
    and dimension both within her pictures and in the frames of them. Stephanie has
    been a dancer for almost two decades, and she uses her experience of how the human
    body moves and emotes to create a bridge into her artwork, not only to depict
    humans, but also trees, other plants, insects, ephemeral guides and strange creatures.
    Early on, her career moved through the illustration and gaming world, but in recent
    decades she has focused more on her own body of work, gallery shows, and publications.
    She taught The Fantastic Workshop of Nashville, TN in 2016 and 2018, and won Best
    in Show at Dragoncon in 2015 for When Flowers Dream. '
